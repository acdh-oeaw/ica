      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        During the last ten years the members of the interdisciplinary commission the North Atlantic
        Triangle have explored the close transatlantic links between Europeans and North Americans
        and the exchange of people and ideas in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. They have in
        particular documented the networks established especially in the years between the two World
        Wars in a number of volumes, and have underlined the importance of these relationships for
        the refugees from Nazi Germany, including Austria after the Anschluss; who sought a safe
        haven in the USA. In the initial phase of establishing the database the ties of friendship
        between several of the many American foreign correspondents simultaneously stationed in
        Vienna (!) and a number of visiting writers (as well as numerous physicians attending
        courses arranged by the American Medical Association in Vienna) on the one hand, and members
        of the Austrian social and cultural elite, on the other, are highlighted, and the fact that
        the proximity of their residences in Vienna facilitated contacts and interaction is
        demonstrated. These networks later – through affidavits supplied by American friends ¬
        facilitated the search for safety in North America, where the refugees found support and
        employment, especially close to the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts – particularly in
        academic fields, and in the realms of music and the theater. This fact is visualized with
        the help of the Geographic Information System. The database will also illustrate the
        fortunes and activities of the (relatively few) returnees among the emigrants, and show the
        effect and significance of the exchange of ideas across the North Atlantic, all so far
        documented in the ten volumes published by the commission since 2012.

        Search in the database will eventually permit interested users to identify key agents in the
        transatlantic cultural exchange, especially between the 1920s and 1960s. It will allow them
        to recognize the role of encounters in the biographies of scores of individuals in Central
        Europe and in the USA and Canada whose autobiographies and correspondence reflect these
        ties, and permit the users to note the stimulation of professional careers in the media, the
        arts and in academe by such contacts. It will also encourage the users to trace the impact
        of transatlantic interaction on the genesis of non-fictional and fictional texts, on plays
        and musical compositions, and on the evolution of (shared) philosophical and political
        ideas. It will also help to assess the consequences of such exchanges for the perception of
        the different societies and the development of their various institutions. The database will
        aid the users in their attempts to comprehend the historical shifts in the relationship
        between the countries of Europe and North America.
