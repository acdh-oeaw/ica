Clearly, Freud had become increasingly interested in the genius of H.D., known to him as Mrs. Aldington, whose publications he wanted to read. H.D. then traveled to Vienna and stayed in the Hotel Regina, close to Freud’s consulting room at Berggasse 19 for the extended periods in 1933 and 1934.',

        'The Austrian historian Friedrich Engel-Janosi was very active in Viennese intellectual circles in the interwar years, attending discussion circles with Alfred F. Pribram, Oskar Morgenstern, Alfred Schütz and Eric Voegelin. His singular combination of archival research and the initiation of major editions as well as his inquiry into crucial theoretical issues of the historical discipline, the history of political ideas and the philosophy of historiography were crucial at the time. His intensive work with sources reflects historical periods from the Renaissance to the twentieth century, with a focus on Austria-Hungary. \r\nEngel-Janosi contributed importantly as a dedicated teacher, to whom many historians owe a debt of gratitude . He encouraged and inspired many of them as a mentor.  He also faced disappointments as a distinguished scholar confronted with provincialism as his full academic reinstatement in Austria was held up by various bureaucratic hurdles.\r\n\r\nHe was a prolific scholar in the field of Austrian history of the 19th century with a large number of  significant editions of documents but also with major publications on historical scholarship generally and the philosophical implications of historiography.',

In early 1922, Dorothy Thompson had arranged with her a revision of her husband Josef Bard’s English translation of poems by the prominent Hungarian poet Endre Ady [Andrew Ady], which was jointly undertaken in Budapest and continued by Millay and Bard after Thompson had returned to Vienna for professional reasons.

      notes:
        'Wilder came to know Vienna and Austria in 1928, established a close friendship with his translator Herbert Egon Herlitschka and repeatedly returned to Vienna. He was an admirer of the Salzburg Festival and he benefited greatly from the theatre tradition in Austria. He was inspired by his reading of Nestroy and visits to the Wiener Volkstheater. His 1938 play “The Merchant of Yonkers” was an adaptation of Nestroy’s play “Einen Jux will er sich machen” (1842). Under the direction of Max Reinhardt, the play premiered on Brodway in 1938 but was not met with  much commercial success, unlike Wilder’s rewriting of it, which was published under the title “The Matchmaker” in 1954. During WWII, Wilder helped (or, in some cases, tried to help) many of his friends and acquaintance to emigrate. (see Zacharasiewicz, Waldemar. Transatlantic Networks and the Perception and Representation of Vienna and Austria Between the 1920s and 1950s. Vienna: Austrian Academy of Science Press, 2018).  \r\nWilder was eager to explain his duties to other friends and aquaintances and he mentioned a number of people whom he had met socially during his sojourns in Vienna or Salzburg and who had been ostracized in Austria after the Nazi takeover, reduced to indigence, and had fled. The ties of friendship that had developed pompted Wilder’s characteristic generosity in helping those in need. He listened to their appeals. In a letter to his friend Herbert Herlitschka he mentioned his own efforts on behalf of "a number of Viennese ... trying to help them find work." He listed Dr. Bermann, Dr. Franz Lehner, Hertha Schweiger, Dr. Ernst Waldinger and others.\r\nWilder had established a close relationship with the Jewish (Austrian) dramatist and poet Richard Beer-Hofmann, whose precarious existence in his American exile is reflected in Beer-Hofmann’s letters to Wilder in German. Notes of thanks bear witness not only to Wilder’s generous support of exiled friends but also to his sharing news about the progress of Wilder’s adaptation of the material from the "Wiener Volkskomödie" for the stage with the exiled writer, who had lost his audience. Wilder supported not only the publication of a translation of Beer-Hofmann’s complex play "Jaakobs Traum", for which he composed an introduction, but also tried to promote its staging with prominent actors. Furthermore, Wilder had a very personal correspondence with Beer-Hofmann’s daughters in the 1950s which reflects his loyalty and ongoing support for the family of his exiled peer and his legacy, as well as his interest in their efforts to reclaim confiscated property in Austria.',

Among other places, they also visited London, where Wilson learned of the terrible events in Austria during that time. "Her diary entries in the journal from July and August 1938 also mirror\r\ngrowing anxieties resulting from German military maneuvers, and\r\nforebodings of worse things to come." These impressions informed the unpublished poem "Vienna, Spring, 1938" and also found entry into her novel "We Have to Sit Opposite" (see Zacharasiewicz, Transatlantic Networks, pp. 249).',

He worked for the Information Service Branch and was responsible for the denazification of artists and the dissemination of American plays. The Austro-Fascist sentiments expressed in his novels have been criticised by fellow exile Berthold Viertel. \r\nIn his novels he gives a very positive image of Austrian patriots in opposition to the Nazis.\r\nThe fact that he did not participate in the Brecht-boycott illustrates that Lothar's anti-communism was more nuanced than Weigel's, Haeusserman's and Torberg's.",

        'As a foreign observer of the Austrian Civil War, Bartlett did not join the\r\nmajority of British journalists in condemning the political acts of the\r\nleaders of the conservative and clerical party in Austria. In his\r\nautobiographical reminiscences contained in This Is My Life, first\r\npublished in 1937, Bartlett expressed his sympathy for their dilemma,\r\ndescribing it as desperate. Unlike others, he also did not condemn Chancellor Dollfuss. Following the assassination of the Chancellor in July 1934, he expressed\r\nhis respect for the “cheerful, well-meaning, hard-working little man”\r\n(224), whose funeral he attended and covered in a broadcast to England. In his role as an early broadcaster Bartlett thus mediated\r\nan image of the situation in Austria in 1934 which differed from that\r\nfurnished by most Anglophone journalists.(Zacharasiewicz, Transatlantic Networks, p. 186)',

His lack of first hand experience of Vienna did not, however, restrain him from giving detailled impressions of the city and the rest of Austria in Never Call Retreat (1942). After "we arrived in Linz, Austria, which I\'ve written about in NCR but never seen" he admits to it being "beautiful". \r\nIn the 1920s and 30s he was a significant contributor to debates on necessary social reforms in the US and also wrote about his radical reform ideas in The New Masses. He was an early critic of fascism and until the Stalin-Hitler Pact of 1939 a follower of American Communism.',

        'Robert Best was born in South Carolina. From 1922 onwards, he \r\n worked for the United Press in Vienna. He was chiefly responsible for organizing the regular table of journalists and foreign correspondents at Café Louvre, which became an essential meeting and networking place during the interwar years. Following the Anschluss, he contineued reporting for the United Press until 1941. After Germany declared war on the U.S., he was incarcerated and supposed to return to the States in 1942; however, he refused to leave. Instead, he volunteered to be a propagandist for the Germans. According to his former colleague, William Shirer, he also became violently anti-Semitic during this time. In 1946, he was finally transported back to the United States as a prisoner for treason and convicted in 1948. He died in prison in 1952.

        'Viertel was a very versatile theater director and dramaturge, who worked as a director in many theaters first in Germany (Dresden and Berlin) and from 1927 in Hollywood, where he worked as a film director for Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. He frequently changed his abode from the West to the East Coast of the United States. From 1918 to 1947 he was married to Salka Viertel, who invited writers and artists to her “Salon” in Hollywood. He received American citizenship in 1942 but returned after WW2 to Austria, where he staged many plays, often using his translations of plays, for instance, by Tennessee Williams.',

        'Mencken functioned as a mediator in a transatlantic network including the family of Leon Kellner,  who himself passed away in 1928. After the "Anschluss", Mencken was very active on behalf of this Jewish family. Mencken wrote numerous letters for Kellner’s grandson, submitted affidavits to the U.S. State Department, petitioned the U.S. Consul in Australia (where the young man was temporarily interned) and pledged that he would personally "take care" of Stefan Benjamin "in case he [ran] into difficulties" in the United States.\r\nMencken interceded as well for Kellner’s second daughter and nephew, and he spent a great deal of time, in perticular, helping Kellner’s granddaughter, Hannah Arnold, a medical student, who had recently escaped from Vienna only to be trapped in Zurich. He besieged the authorities in Washington with requests for papers, signed her affidavit, and agreed that he would "provide financial aisstance" for her if necessary.\r\nMencken sponsored several members of the Kellner family, thus "quietly helping Jews to escape from Hitler’s terror" and bringing them to the United States.',
